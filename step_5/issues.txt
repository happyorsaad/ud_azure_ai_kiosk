1. The first issue was with the custom vision service. It was unable to give good results on test data. So I tried increasing the training time and tagged more data.
2. The second issue was with the face detection API using the thumbnails extracted from video analyser. It was unable to resolve faces in some thumbnails. I added a try catch to train the person group only on faces that could be resolved.
